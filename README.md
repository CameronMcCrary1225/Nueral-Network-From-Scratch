# Nueral-Network-From-Scratch
This project contains a Nueral Network testing the mnst data set built in c/c++
The nueral network is tested with the mnist data set. Here are the results

Baseline Test:
Epoch  1 /  3, Batch 1200 / 1200, Average Cost: 0.5567
Test Completed. Accuracy:  8836 / 10000 (88.4%), Average Cost: 0.4014
Epoch  2 /  3, Batch 1200 / 1200, Average Cost: 0.2256
Test Completed. Accuracy:  9079 / 10000 (90.8%), Average Cost: 0.3186
Epoch  3 /  3, Batch 1200 / 1200, Average Cost: 0.2852
Test Completed. Accuracy:  9170 / 10000 (91.7%), Average Cost: 0.2881
Training time: 25.93 seconds

The project features custom memory allocation, and rng number generation, and a efficent implementation of a nueral net.
The implementation is inspired by magicalbat videos on youtube.
The theory for the implementation was provided to me by 3blue1brown on youtube.
